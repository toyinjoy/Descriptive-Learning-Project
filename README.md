The goal is to identify and analyse frequent patterns in Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) hospitalisation records using classical algorithms: Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat.


## Techniques Used

- Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM)
- FP-Growth, Apriori, and Eclat
- Subgroup Discovery
- Stratified Analysis (Age, Sex, Outcome)
